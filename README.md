This repo contains personal practice projects that exercise and reinforce embedded code concepts,
techniques, and enforced practices. Currently using the Arduino UNO and specifically the Atmega328
microcontroller. Each iteration of projects will adhere to better practices from the previous and
will rely less on the Arduino library for functionality. I will also gradually update this as well!
